Some of my presentations on interesting topics:
* [Exploration of chaos in shock waves](pdfs/Presentation_575.pdf)

Click on movie to see the videos.
* [Computational techniques for problems in civil engineering: Finite Volumes](pdfs/Civil_clawpack.pdf)
* [Modeling Chemotaxis using fractional step approaches](pdfs/Chemotaxis.pdf)
* [Design of a wall-climbing robot](pdfs/Design.pptx)
* [Simulating a system for microfluidic recirculation ](pdfs/MEMS.pptx)
* [Petri Nets](pdfs/Petri_Nets.pptx)

Sadly, the simulations were separate from the presentation in this one.
