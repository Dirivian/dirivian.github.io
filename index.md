I am an Applied Math PhD candidate at Northwestern University. Did my masters in applied math at the University of Washington and my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from BITS-Pilani. Worked for a year in between at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Centre for Applicable Mathematics.
You can find more information in my [CV](pdfs/CV_Jithin_Nov2022.pdf).

My research interests revolve around a theme of elegant scientific computing. This includes beautiful analytic techniques (contour deformations, asymptotic expansions), insightful numerical methods (spectral methods and low rank representations) and clever algorithms. Please contact me if you are interested in working on anything related to these topics.

Here are two of my simulations from papers that inspired me:
Double periodic solutions in detonation waves (from [Kasimov 2013](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.104104)) and well-balanced numerical schemes to watch a rising thermal bubble.
