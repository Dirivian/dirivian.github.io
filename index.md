I am an **Applied Math** PhD candidate at **Northwestern University**. Did my masters in applied math at the **University of Washington** and my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from **BITS-Pilani**. Worked for a year in between at the **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Centre for Applicable Mathematics**.
You can find more information in my **[CV](pdfs/CV_Jithin_Nov2022.pdf)**.

My research interests revolve around a theme of **elegant scientific computing**. This includes beautiful analytic techniques (contour deformations, asymptotic expansions), insightful numerical methods (spectral methods and low rank representations), clever algorithms and their applications. Please contact me if you are interested in working on anything related to these topics.



Here's a simulation of rising thermal bubble made with a well-balanced scheme.
