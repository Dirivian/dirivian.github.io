I am an Applied Math Ph.D candidate at **Northwestern University**. Previously at the University of Washington, BITS-Pilani and TIFR-CAM. 
You can find more information in my **[CV](pdfs/CV_Jithin_Nov2022.pdf)**.



My research interests revolve around a theme of **elegant scientific computing**. I like to work on topics that feature beautiful analytic techniques (contour deformations, asymptotic expansions), insightful numerical methods (spectral methods and low rank representations), clever algorithms and their applications. Always up for discussing anything related to these topics.
