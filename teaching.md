I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the following courses

 The resources page has some excellent material for scientific computation in MATLAB.

* [PHY 121 Mechanics](http://courses.washington.edu/phys121z/index.php)

Here are some presentations that I have given on interesting topics:
* [Computational techniques for problems in civil engineering: Finite Volumes](pdfs/marian_final.pdf)
