I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the following courses
* [AMATH 301 - Beginning Scientific Computing](http://courses.washington.edu/am301/)
The resources page has a lot of excellent material for scientific computation in MATLAB open to all.
* [PHY 121 Mechanics](http://courses.washington.edu/phys121z/index.php)
