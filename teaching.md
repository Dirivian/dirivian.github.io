I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the following courses
* [AMATH 301 - Beginning Scientific Computing](http://courses.washington.edu/am301/):
 The resources page has some excellent material for scientific computation in MATLAB.

* [PHY 121 Mechanics](http://courses.washington.edu/phys121z/index.php)
      This line won't *have any markdown* formatting applied.
      I can even write <b>HTML</b> and it will show up as text.
      This is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even
      Markdown. <b>this won't show up as HTML</b> but
      exactly <i>as you see it in this text file</i>.
Some of my presentations on interesting topics:
* [Computational techniques for problems in civil engineering: Finite Volumes](pdfs/marian_final.pdf)
